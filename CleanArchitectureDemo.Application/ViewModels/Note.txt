A view model represents the data that you want to display on your view/page, whether it be used for static text or for input values (like textboxes and dropdown lists) that can be added to the database (or edited). 

It is something different than your domain model. It is a model for the view. 

In other words, it creates a mask for the domain models.

For the time being we will get a list of Books from the database.
